## Introduction

Axonexa simulates Diffusion and Magnetic Resonance Imaging in White Matter **Axon** environments through Monte Carlo methods. The design of the code aims to make use of upcoming heterogeneous **Exa**-scale super-computers that have CUDA-enabled GPUs.

This work is based on my [Honours Thesis (2013)](https://github.com/trevor-vincent/Axonexa/blob/60915c02f16623a1af1f538640d377010fb0c678/docs/HonoursThesis_TrevorVincent_13-05-2013.pdf) and I am slowly modernizing it. The first stable version will be given a release tag, so please stay tuned.

The code has been used in 2 scientific publications, expanded on in a Phd Thesis by Morgan Mercredi, and an honours thesis by [Michael Honke](https://github.com/mlhonke/mri_sim). An impact section is forthcoming.
